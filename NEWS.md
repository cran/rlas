### rlas v1.3.8

- Switch to C++14 to use boost 1.75.0 (see [#49](https://github.com/Jean-Romain/rlas/issues/49))

### rlas v1.3.7

- Fix [#48](https://github.com/Jean-Romain/rlas/issues/48). `header_set_epsg()` inccorectly set the epsg code when the key 3072 is missing but the VLR is not empty

### rlas v1.3.6

- Fix: The function `is_valid_ReturnNumber()` wrongly triggered errors when checking if the ReturnNumber attribute is correct. It missed errors for LAS < 1.4 and triggered wrong errors for LAS 1.4 prf > 6. [#45](https://github.com/Jean-Romain/rlas/pull/45)
- Fix: The function `is_empty_point_cloud()` did not actually test what it was expected to test.
- Fix: `is_valid_scalefactors()` does not trigger any report for very fine scale factors such as 0.000001 that is a valid scale of long/lat coordinates.
- Fix: `is_valid_returnnumber()` does not complain for ReturnNumber = 0. This is valid but not compliant to the specs. 
- Fix: formats 5, 7 and 10 were missing in the list of formats valid for storing RGB
- Fix: format 10 was missing in the list of formats valid for storing NIR
- Fix: more tests and fixes relative to asprs specification
- New: new parameter transform to apply streaming transformations
- New: list of filters and transformations are available via `read.las(filter = "-h")` and  `read.las(transform = "-h")`
- Enhancement: las specification tests now check for NAs

### rlas v1.3.5

- Change: defunc deprecated functions `check_data`, `check_header` and `check_data_vs_header`.
- Fix: `is_valid_ScanAngle()` triggers an error if |a| > 196.6 instead of 180. 196.6 is the maximum writable angle but is not compliant with the specs ([#44](https://github.com/Jean-Romain/rlas/issues/44)).
- New: function `is_compliant_ScanAngle()` to check the compliance of the Scan Angle.

### rlas v1.3.4

- Fix: One Definition Rule (ODR) violation in LASzip (LTO issue)
- Note: use the function `tabulate()` instead of home made C++ code to count the return numbers. 

### rlas v1.3.3

* New: unlock reading `.ply` files in `read.las` and `read.lasheader`. This is an undocumented feature not actually intended to be used. ([#39](https://github.com/Jean-Romain/rlas/issues/40)).
* New: verbose option in `writelax()`.
* Fix: ([#40](https://github.com/Jean-Romain/rlas/issues/40)) in `read.las` and `read.lasheader` modifications in string encoding in R 3.5.0 generated issues with path containing special characters. Native encoding is now enforced.

### rlas v1.3.2 (Release date: 2019-04-26)

* Fix: [#33](https://github.com/Jean-Romain/rlas/issues/33) it is now allowed to write `ScanAngleRank` above 90 degrees but not above 127 degrees.
* Fix: [#34](https://github.com/Jean-Romain/rlas/issues/34) fix a misinterpretation of the LAS specification. Offset can be negative.
* Fix: [#35](https://github.com/Jean-Romain/rlas/issues/35) Erreur reading a specific laz file. The actual problem is unknown. This has been fixed by updating `LASlib`
* Fix: [#36](https://github.com/Jean-Romain/rlas/issues/35) Classification was zeroed when writing LAS1.4 prf 6. The actual problem is not known. This has been fixed by updating `LASlib`
* Fix: `ScanAngle` was rounded to integer for LAS 1.4 prf >= 6 before to be written. With the 0.006 factor conversion this lead to unrelated values when reading back a written file.
* Change: `header_create()` does not generates random UUID. The UUID is set to `"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"`. Dependence to `uuid` has been removed.
* Change: Dependancies to `sp`, `sf` and `rgeos` were no longer useful. `rlas` only depends on `data.table + Rcpp`.

### rlas v1.3.1 (Release date: 2019-02-08)

* Fix: valgrind - Conditionnal jump on uninitialized value (consequentless for users)

* New: introduction of a set of 5+ functions to modify a header easily repecting LAS specifications
* Fix: [#26](https://github.com/Jean-Romain/rlas/issues/26) segfault in `read.las` when using an inappropriated filter such as -keep_class 123.

### rlas v1.2.9 (Release date: 2018-10-26)

* New: `write.las` writes the epsg code in the header.

### rlas v1.2.6 (Release date: 2018-08-20)

* Change: `check_data` now check the adequation between the `ReturnNumber`and the `NumberOfReturns`
* Fix: `las` format 7 was supported at the C++ level when reading a file but an old test still throw an error at the R level stating that this format was not supported.
* Fix: several compilation warnings on CRAN
* Change: `readlasdata` and `readlasheader` were definitively removed.

### rlas v1.2.4 (Release date: 2018-06-10)

* Reupload on CRAN after being removed.

### rlas v1.2.3 (Release date: 2018-05-17)

* New: Read the classification flags in fields `Synthetic_flag`, `Keypoint_flag` and `Withheld_flag`.

* New: enables the support of files with point data formats 6, 7 and 8 in read mode.
* New: enables the support of extra bytes attributes in write mode.
* New: function `read.las` that replaces `readlasdata`, which is now deprecated. The selection of the field to be loaded is made easier by use of string syntax instead of multiple logical parameters.
* New: function `read.lasheader` that replaces `readlasheader`, which is now deprecated. This change was made only for naming consistency.
* New: functions `header_*` that allows the user to make valid headers and thus properly write the las files.
* New: functions `check_*` that check data integrity.
* Fix [[#9](https://github.com/Jean-Romain/rlas/issues/9)] with valgrind: uninitialized value(s)

* New: function `writelax` for writing LAX files.
* New: function `readlasdata` enable for reading several files.
* Fix: the las files were read twice every time. `lasdatareader` is twice as fast since it reads files only once

### rlas v1.1.1 (Release date: 2017-03-15)

* Fix: [[#3](https://github.com/Jean-Romain/rlas/issues/3)] `readlasdata()` is able to read file when LAS specifications are not respected.
* Change: `writelas` performs tests on the header before entering C++ code (enable to fail with informative errors).
