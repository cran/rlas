### rlas v1.2.3 (Release date: 2018-05-17)

#### NEW FEATURES

* Read the classification flags in fields `Synthetic_flag`, `Keypoint_flag` and `Withheld_flag`.

#### BUG FIXES:

* Fix: point in polygon includes the points that define the polygon.
* Fix: [[#21](https://github.com/Jean-Romain/rlas/issues/21)] writing a vector that contains only NAs in extra bytes
* Fix: additional warnings on CRAN with gcc 8+
* Fix: [[#19](https://github.com/Jean-Romain/rlas/issues/19)] additional errors on CRAN with valgrind

### rlas v1.2.1 (Release date: 2018-04-13)

#### BUG FIXES:

* Fix: [[#18](https://github.com/Jean-Romain/rlas/issues/18)] additional errors on CRAN with ASAN and USBAN

### rlas v1.2.0 (Release date: 2018-04-10)

#### NEW FEATURES

* Enables the support of files with point data formats 6, 7 and 8 in read mode.
* Enables the support of extra bytes attributes in write mode.
* New function `read.las` that replaces `readlasdata`, which is now deprecated. The selection of the field to be loaded is made easier by use of string syntax instead of multiple logical parameters.
* New function `read.lasheader` that replaces `readlasheader`, which is now deprecated. This change was made only for naming consistency.
* New functions `header_*` that allows the user to make valid headers and thus properly write the las files.
* New functions `check_*` that check data integrity.

#### BUG FIXES:

* Fix [[#9](https://github.com/Jean-Romain/rlas/issues/9)] with valgrind: uninitialized value(s)

### rlas v1.1.9 (Release date: 2018-01-17)

#### BUG FIXES:

* Fix a segfault when reading extrabytes

### rlas v1.1.8 (Release date: 2018-01-15)

#### NEW FEATURES

* new straighforward C++ class `RLASstreamer` to use `rlas`at the C++ level.
* Support of extra bytes attributes in `readlasdata`

#### BUG FIXES:

* Fix some internal features that cannot be used by regular users. Does not affect users.

### rlas v1.1.5 (Release date: 2017-10-23)

#### NEW FEATURES

* `writelax` enabled for writing LAX files.
* `readlasdata` enabled for reading several files.
* Moved the headers in `inst/include` to make the lib callable from other packages

#### BUG FIXES:

* The las files were read twice every time. `lasdatareader` is twice as fast since it reads files only once
* `readlasdata` enables loading (or not) of the gpstime field.

### rlas v1.1.4 (Release date: 2017-07-26)

#### BUG FIXES:
